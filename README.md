# README of the Developmental AI for ROS project

This repository provides code for practicing developmental AI in the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) environment.

world.py provides the general framework for implementing a developmental agent and testing it in rudimentary environments. 
It is a standalone file that can run in any python environment.

turtlesim_enacter.py provides the interface between a developmental agent and the [turtlesim simulator](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim). 
It requires a ROS installation. 

See the [wiki](https://github.com/OlivierGeorgeon/TestROS/wiki) to learn how to use it (French).
